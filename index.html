    <h3>CHANGELOG v0.0.0.3</h3>
    <p style="text-align: start;">- we've added an assortment of bizarre potions that could enhance your gameplay or render you completely useless. will you risk it? your friends will be sure to appreciate the irony when the potion of invisibility leaves you stuck in a wall!</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">- coins now have a 50% chance to disappear on collection, because why should success come easily in a world full of bad decisions? collecting them provides a small burst of hope before they vanish, much like your motivation on a monday morning.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">- a glitch where characters would unceremoniously fall out of the map has been fixed! players can now face their existential dread without being physically swallowed into the abyss.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">- in an effort to promote realism, we've dialed back the vibrant colors and cheery backgrounds. the new dreary palette is perfect for those who feel that real life is often best represented through shades of gray.</p>
    <p style="text-align: start;">- oh and we also can't fix favicon for the website, this crap doesn't work at all...</p>
    <h2>THAT'S ALL! Now play the game! pls.</h2>
