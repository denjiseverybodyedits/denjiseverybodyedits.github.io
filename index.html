    <h3>CHANGELOG v0.0.0.2</h3>
    <h4>we added bruce chuddy smiley! ultimate godmode block that will give you godmode forever! and the best worst best campaign! our campaign maker SirDaniel caught a stroke and was breakdancing while on video call while making it but it was worth it! he's going to add seven more levels next year!</h4>
    <h4>we will add more stuff, such as npcs with ai! but it'll take a lot of time for us to code that crap! we used chatGPT to get some code, and it works! next update 0.0.0.3 will release next year! we also added unreal engine 4 support and unity and java and roblox studio support so your pc can run our most modern version!</h4>
    <h4>we also made a special smiley for our most special fan and player ScarFaceMCFan! we hope he will like it! and it'll tell him if he's a real chad or a beta!</h4>
